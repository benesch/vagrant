      docker_provider_nfs_without_privileged: |-
        You've configured a NFS synced folder but didn't enable privileged
        mode for the container. Please set the `privileged` option to true
        on the provider block from your Vagrantfile, recreate the container
        and try again.
      docker_provider_image_not_configured: |-
        The base Docker image has not been set for the '%{name}' VM!
      synced_folder_non_docker: |-
        The "docker" synced folder type can't be used because the  provider
        in use is not Docker. This synced folder type only works with the
        Docker provider. The provider this machine is using is: %{provider}
