      host_unsupported: |-
        Vagrant doesn't support running an RDP client on your
        host OS. Currently only Windows is supported for RDP
        clients.

        If you wish for the OS you're running to support launching
        an RDP client, please contribute this functionality back
        into Vagrant. At the very least, open an issue on how it
        could be done and we can handle the integration.
