        The provider being used to start Windows ('%{provider}')
        doesn't support the "nic_mac_addresses" capability which is required
        for advanced networking to work with Windows guests. Please inform
        the author of the provider to add this feature.

        Until then, you must remove any networking configurations other
        than forwarded ports from your Vagrantfile for Vagrant to continue.
